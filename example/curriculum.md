## Summary

I'm a **software engineer** with more than **10 years of experience**, having
worked both as an in-house developer and as a consultant. I've had the
opportunity to **build and lead tech teams**, and genuinely enjoy facilitating
communication and coordinating efforts.

I see myself as a software craftsman, and therefore always make sure we ship
**high-quality code** as a team. I strive for excellence and share my passion,
ideas and practices with those around me. I'm also interested in other
disciplines such as design and product management, which enables me to bring a
holistic approach to product development and business.

I wrote a book, *[Instant Markdown][3]*, published by Packt
Publishing, and occasionally speak at conferences and _meetups_.


## Experience

Mastered is an online learning platform for professionals in the fashion

first Bitcoin exchange in the UK. Speed, scalability, security and reliability
were key features in the development, and the system was based on a Ruby
microservices architecture communicated with RabbitMQ.

#### **Software Engineer** at *Cambridge Healthcare*. May 2013 - Dec 2013

I worked building a health record, analytics and open API. My main project was

APIs implemented using HTTP and REST principles, Entity-Boundary-Interactor
architecture, Elasticsearch and Redis for persistence.

#### **Software Engineer** at *[OSOCO][7]*. Nov 2010 - Mar 2013
