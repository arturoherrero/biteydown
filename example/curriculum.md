## Summary

I am a **software engineer** with more than **6 years of experience**. I am interested
in dynamic programming languages, mainly **Ruby** and **Groovy**. I am highly
experienced in web development and last year I worked on building a
Bitcoin exchange from the webapp to the datastore. I love to create elegant
software that is easy to read and provides immediate and lasting value to its users.

I have been involved in several successful projects as a member of a **Scrum
team**, participating in the analysis, design and development. I am interested
in **agile management** techniques.

I have a **Linux** background and also enjoy doing **system administration**
tasks.

I wrote a book about Markdown with Packt Publishing: **[Instant Markdown][3]**.

Occasionally, I **speak at software conferences**: Agile Spain Conference,
Greach, Codemotion, SoCraTes UK and local user groups.
