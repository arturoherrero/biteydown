## Summary

I'm a **software engineer** interested in dynamic programming languages, mainly **Ruby** and **Groovy**. I'm highly experienced in web development and the last months I've worked mostly building different **RESTful web services**. I love to create elegant software that is easy to read and provides immediate and lasting value to its users.

I have been involved in several successful projects as a member of a **Scrum team**, participating in the analysis, design and development. I'm interested in **agile management** techniques.
