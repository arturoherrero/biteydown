## Summary

I am a **software engineer** with more than **6 years of experience**. I have
experience working with different dynamic programming languages, especially
**Ruby** and **Groovy**, and I am looking to deepen my knowledge in functional
languages. I am highly experienced in web development and complex
architectures. I love creating elegant software that is easy to read and
provides immediate and lasting value to its users.
